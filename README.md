# Apredictive System for Anticipating Areas of Potential Unrest
 
 DIRISA Student Datathon challenge Team qualification
 
# Problem Statement
South Africa faces recurring service delivery protests driven by failures in providing essential services such as water, electricity, sanitation, and housing. These protests disrupt communities, strain government resources, and impact economic stability.

# Aim:
Predictive Systems for Anticipating Areas of Potential Unrest
By leveraging historical protest data, socio-economic indicators, service delivery metrics, and even real-time data sources such as social media, predictive analytics models can help government agencies and municipalities proactively allocate resources, identify at-risk communities, and engage in early interventions.

Data Preprocessing:
Load and clean the dataset (handle missing values, convert timestamps, calculate ride duration).
Convert categorical features into numerical representations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand data distributions and relationships using statistical analysis.
Model Training & Evaluation:
Train models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Evaluate using RMSE, MAE, and R² score.
Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimize model parameters using GridSearchCV for improved performance.
Deployment:
Develop an interactive Streamlit web application for users to input ride details and get fare predictions.

Clone this repository.
Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the Streamlit app using streamlit run app.py.
Input ride details to get fare predictions.
