# Apredictive System for Anticipating Areas of Potential Unrest
 
 DIRISA Student Datathon challenge Team qualification
 
# Problem Statement
South Africa faces recurring service delivery protests driven by failures in providing essential services such as water, electricity, sanitation, and housing. These protests disrupt communities, strain government resources, and impact economic stability.

# Aim:
Predictive Systems for Anticipating Areas of Potential Unrest
By leveraging historical protest data, socio-economic indicators, service delivery metrics, and even real-time data sources such as social media, predictive analytics models can help government agencies and municipalities proactively allocate resources, identify at-risk communities, and engage in early interventions.
